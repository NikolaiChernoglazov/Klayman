This is a work-in-progress repository for a Keyboard Layout Management solution.

The idea is to create a tool that can automate switching process between multiple keyboard layouts.

It's easy to switch between two layouts, but what if you need to have more? Imagine your native language is French, your work language is English and you've decided to learn German. To type in German, you will have to add a new German keyboard layout to the system. But you will not need German all the time, only when you study it.
What to do if you have finished your German session and don't need that language yet? Having an extra German layout together with English and French may be a little frustrating when switching languages, because you will have to skip German and it's easy to forget doing so, which could lead to typos.The other option would be to remove German layout for a while, and than adding it again when needed, but that's not very convenient.

With Klayman, it would be possible to solve this problem by having multiple keyboard layout sets, for example, English + French and English + German. Each set would have its own hotkey set-up, so instead of going to the settings and manually adding/removing layouts you'll just have to press some key combination, and you will have only the keyboard layouts you need in the particular time.

Currently the development focus will be on a CLI tool for Winows. The GUI app and Linux support may come later.
